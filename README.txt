If running from a IdE go to /lexical/resources/test.kxi and add your kxi code to get the assembly code file "test1.asm". 
You can then use my VM from my VM repository to run the assembly code. 

If running from the termminal when building provide the name/path the your kxi code to compile, then once you have "test1.asm" use the VM from my VM 
repository to run the assembly code.

This Compiler/Vm supports Class's/Objects, Arrays, Functions, recursive functions and more, see KXI2020.pdf for details
